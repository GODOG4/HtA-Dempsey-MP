# HtA-Dempsey-MP
Fork of HtA Lovesick with Dempsey Approvedâ„¢ changes

Main mod here: https://github.com/GODOG4/HtA-Lovesick-MP

Changelog:

* Got rid of the Infamy buffs from the original mod as per Dempsey's request
* Nerfed Syria and Babylon so they don't have nearly a million pops by 1840
* Brandenburg Germany gets Lithuanian instead of Ashkenazi
* BYZ and Armenia start at war at game start
* Added SteelRyan's inflation monitoring values
* Re-added CBs cancelling when over infamy but now it's at 32.5
* Made it so you need to justify Independence CB so players can't immediately break out of being a puppet.
